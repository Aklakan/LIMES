LIMES is a hybrid framework that combines the mathematical\ncharacteristics of metric spaces as well prefix-, suffix- and position\nfiltering to compute pessimistic approximations of the similarity of\ninstances. These approximations are then used to filter out a large\namount of those instance pairs that do not suffice the mapping\nconditions. By these means, LIMES can reduce the number of comparisons\nneeded during the mapping process by several orders of magnitude and\ncomplexity without loosing a single link.\n[fig:workflow]The general workflow implemented by the LIMES framework is depicted in\nFigure (fig:workflow). Given the source S, the target T and a link\nspecification, LIMES first separates the different data types to merge.\nStrings are processed by using suffix-, prefix- and position filtering\nin the string mapper. Numeric values (and all values that can be mapped\nefficiently to a vector space) are mapped to a metric space and\nprocessed by the HYPPO algorithm. All other values are mapped by using\nthe miscellaneous mapper. The results of all mappers processing are\nfiltered and merged by using time-efficient set and filtering\noperations.TODO Axel Change according to the new workflowThe advantages of LIMESâ€™ approach are manifold. First, it implements\nhighly time-optimized mappers, making it a complexity class faster\nthan other Link Discovery Frameworks. Thus, the larger the problem, the\nfaster LIMES is w.r.t. other Link Discovery Frameworks. In addition,\nLIMES is guaranteed to lead to exactly the same matching as a brute\nforce approach while at the same time reducing significantly the number\nof comparisons. In addition, LIMES supports a large number of input\nand output formats and can be extended very easily to fit new\nalgorithms , new datatypes, new preprocessing functions and others thank\nto its modular architecture displayed in Figure [fig:architecture].\n[fig:architecture]In general, LIMES can be used to set links between two data sources,\ne.g., a novel data source created by a data publisher and existing data\nsource such as DBpedia. This functionality can also be used to\ndetect duplicates within one data source for knowledge curation. The\nonly requirement to carry out these tasks is a simple XML-based\nconfiguration file. The purpose of this manual is to explicate the LIMES\nConfiguration Language (LCL) that underlies these configuration files,\nso as allow users to generate their own configurations. An online\nversion of LIMES is available online at\nhttp://limes.aksw.org.Components of a LIMES XML Configuration FileA LIMES configuration file consists of ten parts, of which some are optional:MetadataThe metadata tag always consists of the following bits of XML:\n\n\nPrefixesDefining a prefix in a LIMES file demands setting two values: \n The namespace that will be addressed by the prefix's label\n    http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\n    rdf\n\nHere, we set the prefix rdf to correspond to http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns\\#. A LIMES link specification can contain as many prefixes as required.Source Data SourceLIMES computes links between items contained in two Linked Data sources dubbed source and target. An example of a configuration for a source data source is shown below.\n    mesh\n    http://mesh.bio2rdf.org/sparql\n    ?y\n    5000\n    ?y rdf:type meshr:Concept\n    dc:title\n    sparql\n\nSix properties need to be set.Each data source must be given an ID via the tag ID.\n\nThe endpoint of the data source needs to be explicated via the ENDPOINT tag.If the data is to be queried from a SPARQL end point, the ENDPOINT tag must be set to the corresponding SPARQL endpoint URI.\n\nIn case the data is stored in a local file (CSV, N3, TURTLE, etc.), ENDPOINT tag must be set to the absolute path of the file containing the data.\n\n\nThe VAR tag describes the variable associated with the aformentioned endpoint. This variable is also used later, when specifying the metric used to link the entities retrieved from the source and target endpoints.\nThe fourth property is set via the PAGESIZE tag. This property must be set to the maximal number of triples returned by the SPARQL endpoint. For example, the DBpedia endpoint returns a maximum of 1000 triples for each query. LIMES' SPARQL module can still retrieve all relevant instances for the mapping even the value is set. If the SPARQL endpoint does not limit the number of triples it returns or if the input is a file, the value of PAGESIZE should be set to -1. \n\nThe restrictions on the queried data can be set via the RESTRICTION tag. This tag allows to constrain the entries that are retrieved the LIMES' query module. In this particular example, we only instances of MESH concepts. \n\nThe PROPERTY tag allows to specify the properties that will be used during the linking. It is important to note that the property tag can also be used to specify the preprocessing on the input data. For example, setting rdfs:label AS nolang, one can ensure that the language tags get removed from each rdfs:label before it is written in the cache. Pre-processing functions can be piped into one another by using ->. For example, rdfs:label AS nolang->lowercase will compute lowercase(nolang(rdfs:label)).\n\nPre-processing FunctionsCurrently, LIMES supports the following set of pre-processing functions:nolang for removing language tags\n\nlowercase for converting the input string into lower case\n\nuppercase for converting the input string into upper case \n\nnumber for ensuring that only the numeric characters, \".\" and \",\" are contained in the input string\n\nreplace(String a,String b) for replacing each occurrence of a with b\n\nregexreplace(String x,String b) for replacing each occurrence the regular excepression x with b\n\ncleaniri for removing all the prefixes from IRIs\n\ncelsius for converting Fahrenheit to Celsius\n\nfahrenheit for converting Celsius to Fahrenheit\n\nremovebraces for removing the braces\n\nregularAlphabet for removing nun-alphanumeric characters\n\nuriasstring returns the last part of an URI as a String. Additional parsing _ as space\n\nSometimes, generating the right link specification might either require merging property values (for example, the dc:title and foaf:name of MESH concepts) or splitting property values (for example, comparing the label and foaf:homepage of source instances and the foaf:homepage of target instances as well as foaf:homepage AS cleaniri of the target instances with the rdfs:label of target instances. To enable this, LIMES provides the RENAME operator which simply store either the values of a property or the results of a preprocessing into a different property field. For example, foaf:homepage AS cleaniri RENAME label would stored the homepage of a object without all the prefixes in the name property. The user could then access this value during the specification of the similarity measure for comparing sources and target instances. Note that the same property value can be used several times. Thus, the following specification fragment is valid and leads to the the dc:title and foaf:name of individuals)  of MESH concepts being first cast down to the lowercase and then merged to a single property.\n    mesh\n    http://mesh.bio2rdf.org/sparql\n    ?y\n    5000\n    ?y rdf:type meshr:Concept\n    dc:title AS lowercase RENAME name\n    foaf:name AS lowercase RENAME name\n    sparql\n\nIn addition, the following allows splitting the values of foaf:homepage into the property values name and homepage.\n    mesh\n    http://mesh.bio2rdf.org/sparql\n    ?y\n    5000\n    ?y rdf:type meshr:Concept\n    foaf:homepage AS lowercase RENAME homepage\n    foaf:homepage AS cleaniri->lowercase RENAME name\n    sparql\n\nIn addition, a source type can be set via TYPE. The default type is set to SPARQL (for a SPARQL endpoint) but LIMES also supports reading files directly from the hard-drive. The supported data formats areCSV: Character-separated file can be loaded directly into LIMES. Note that the separation character is set to TAB as a default. The user can alter this setting programmatically. \n\nN3 (which also reads NT files) reads files in the N3 language.\n\nN-TRIPLE reads files in W3C's core N-Triples format\n\nTURTLE allows reading files in the Turtle syntax.\n\nMoreover, if you want to download data from a SPARQL endpoint, there is no need to set the  tag. \nInstead, if you want to read the source (or target) data from a file, you should fill  tag with the absolute path of the input file, e.g. C:/Files/dbpedia.nt, and you should also set the  tag  with the type of the input data, for example NT.Target Data SourceConfiguring the target data source is very similar to configuring the source data source. The only difference lies in the beginning tag, i.e., TARGET instead of SOURCE. In the example shown below, we retrieve the condition_name of a condition from LinkedCT. We do no set the type of the source. Thus, LIMES supposes it is a SPARQL endpoint.\n    linkedct\n    http://data.linkedct.org/sparql\n    ?x\n    5000\n    ?x rdf:type linkedct:condition\n    linkedct:condition_name\n\nMetric Expression for Similarity MeasurementOne of the core improvements of the newest LIMES kernels is the provision of a highly flexible language for the specification of complex metrics for linking (set by using the METRIC tag as exemplified below).\n    trigrams(y.dc:title, x.linkedct:condition_name)\n\nIn this example, we use the trigrams metric to compare the dc:title of the instances retrieved from the source data source, with which the variable y is associated, with the linkedct: variable x is associated. While such simple metrics can be used in many cases, complex metrics are necessary in complex linking cases. LIMES includes a formal grammar for specifying complex configurations of arbitrary complexity. For this purpose, two categories of binary operations are supported: Metric operations and boolean operations.Metric operationsMetric operations allow to combine metric values. They include the operators MIN, MAX, ADD and MULT, e.g. as follows:MAX(trigrams(x.rdfs:label,y.dc:title),euclidean(x.lat|long, y.latitude|longitude)).\nThis specification computes the maximum of \n1 The trigram similarity of x's \\texttt{rdfs:label} and y's dc:title \n2 The 2-dimension euclidean distance of x's lat and long with y's latitude and longitude, i.e., âˆš((x.lat- y.latitude)^2 + (x.long - y.longitude)^2).Note that euclidean supports arbitrarily many dimensions. In addition, note that ADD allows to define weighted sums as follows:ADD(0.3*trigrams(x.rdfs:label,y.dc:title), 0.7*euclidean(x.lat|x.long,y.latitude|y.longitude)).Boolean operationsBoolean operations allow to combine and filter the results of metric operations and include AND, OR, DIFF, e.g. as AND(trigrams(x.rdfs:label,y.dc:title)|0.9, euclidean(x.lat|x.long, y.latitude|y.longitude)|0.7).This specification returns all links such that \n1. the trigram similarity of x's rdfs:label and y's dc:title is greater or equal to 0.9 and \n2. the 2-dimension euclidean distance of x's lat and long mit y's latitude and longitude is greater or equal to 0.7.The current version of LIMES supports the string following metrics:Trigrams\n\nCosine\n\nJaccard  \n\nLevenshtein\n\nOverlap \n\nJaro \n\nJaroWinkler\n\nMongeElkan \n\nExactMatch\n\nQgrams\n\nRatcliffObershelp\n\nSoundex\n\nTrigram\n\nIn addition, LIMES supports comparing numeric vectors by using theEuclidean metric \n\nGeo_Orthodromic distance \n\nGeo_Great_Elliptic distance\n\nThe similarity between polygons can be measured by using the following point-set distances:Geo_Orthodromic\n\nGeo_NaiveHausdorff \n\nGeo_Indexed_Hausdorff \n\nGeo_Fast_Hausdorff \n\nGeo_Symmetric_Hausdorff\n\nGeo_Centroid_Indexed_Hausdorff\n\nGeo_Scan_Indexed_Hausdorff\n\nGeo_Max\n\nGeo_Min\n\nGeo_Mean\n\nGeo_Avg\n\nGeo_Frechet\n\nGeo_Link\n\nGeo_Sum_Of_Min\n\nGeo_Naive_Surjection\n\nGeo_Fair_Surjection\n\nThe temporal relations between event resources can be found by using the following relations:Tmp_Successor\n\nTmp_Predecessor\n\nTmp_Concurrent\n\nTmp_Before\n\nTmp_After\n\nTmp_Meets\n\nTmp_Is_Met_By\n\nTmp_Finishes\n\nTmp_Is_Finished_By\n\nTmp_Starts\n\nTmp_Is_Stared_By\n\nTmp_During\n\nTmp_During_Reverse\n\nTmp_Overlaps\n\nTmp_Is_Overlapped_By\n\nTmp_Equals\n\nThe topological relations between spatial resources can be found by using the following relations:Top_Contains\n\nTop_Crosses\n\nTop_Disjoint\n\nTop_Equals\n\nTop_Intersects\n\nTop_Overlaps\n\nTop_Touches\n\nTop_Within\n\nTo compare sets of resources (e.g. in rdf containers), use the following relations:Set_Jaccard\n\nMore complex distance measures are being added.Machine LearningIn most cases, finding a good metric expression (i.s. one that achieve high F-Measure) is not a trivial task. Therefore, in LIMES we implemented a number of machine learning algorithm for auto-generation of metric (also called Link Specification). For using a machine learning algorithm in your configuration file use the MLALGORITHM tag instead of the METRIC tag. For example:\n    wombat simple\n    supervised batch\n    trainingData.nt\n     \n        max execution time in minutes\n        60\n    \n\nIn particular:The the tag NAME contains the name of the machine learning algorithm. Currently, we implemented the folowing algorithms:womabt simple\n\nwombat complete\n\neagle\n\n\nThe the tag TYPE contains the type of the machine learning algorithm, which could tak one of the values:supervised batch\n\nsupervised active\n\nunsupervised\n\n\nThe the tag TRAINING contains the full path to the training data file. Note that this tag is not required in case of the supervised active and unsupervised learning algorithms\nThe the tag PARAMETER contains the the name (using the sub-tag NAME) and the value (using the sub-tag VALUE) of the used machine learning algorithm parameter. User can use as many PARAMETER tags as it is required. Note that LIMES uses the default values of all unspecified parameters. \n\nThe following table contains a list of implemented algorithms together with supported implementations and parameters.\n.tg  {border-collapse:collapse;border-spacing:0;}\n.tg td{font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;padding:10px 5px;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;overflow:hidden;word-break:normal;}\n.tg th{font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-weight:normal;padding:10px 5px;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;overflow:hidden;word-break:normal;}\n.tg .tg-baqh{text-align:center;vertical-align:top}\n.tg .tg-yw4l{vertical-align:top}\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    ML Algorithm\n    Supported types\n    Parameter\n    Default Value\n    Note\n  \n  \n    WOMBAT Simple\n    supervised batch, supervised active and unsupervised\n    max refinement tree size\n    2000\n    \n  \n  \n    max iterations number\n    3\n    \n  \n  \n    max iteration time in minutes\n    20\n    \n  \n  \n    max execution time in minutes\n    600\n    \n  \n  \n    max fitness threshold\n    1\n    Range 0 to 1\n  \n  \n    minimum property coverage\n    0.4\n    Range 0 to 1\n  \n  \n    property learning rate\n    0.9\n    Range 0 to 1\n  \n  \n    overall penalty weight\n    0.5\n    Range 0 to 1\n  \n  \n    children penalty weight\n    1\n    Range 0 to 1\n  \n  \n    complexity penalty weight\n    1\n    Range 0 to 1\n  \n  \n    verbose\n    false\n    \n  \n  \n    atomic measures\n    jaccard, trigrams, cosine, qgrams\n    \n  \n  \n    save mapping\n    true\n    \n  \n  \n    WOMBAT Complete\n    supervised batch, supervised active and unsupervised\n    Same as WOMBAT Simple\n  \n  \n    EAGLE\n    supervised batch, supervised active and unsupervised\n    **TODO** Tomasso\n    \n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\nAcceptance ConditionFilling the acceptance condition consists of setting the threshold value to the minimum value that two instances must have in order to satisfy a relation. This can be carried out as exemplified below.\n    0.98\n    accepted.nt\n    owl:sameAs\n\nBy using the \\verb#THRESHOLD# tag, the user can set the minimum value that two instances must have in order to satisfy the relation specified in the \\verb#RELATION# tag, i.e., \\verb#owl:sameAs# in our example. Setting the tag  allows to specify where the links should be written. Currently, LIMES produces output files in the N3 format.Future versions of LIMES will allow to write the output to other streams and in other data formats.Review ConditionSetting the condition upon which links must be reviewed manually is very similar to setting the acceptance condition as shown below.\n    0.95\n    reviewme.nt\n    owl:sameAs\n\nAll instances that have a similarity between the threshold set in REVIEW (0.95 in our example) and the threshold set in ACCEPTANCE (0.98 in our example) will be written in the review file and linked via the relation set in REVIEW.The LIMES configuration file should be concluded with Granularity (optional)The user can choose positive integers to set the granularity of HYPPO, HR3 or ORCHID by setting2.\nOutput FormatThe user can choose

Each metric corresponds to one mapper. One mapper can correspond to more that one metric. The Measures package is divided into two sub-packages: Measure and Mapper:The Measure packages includes the interface IMeasure, the abstract class AMeasure, the set of metrics implemented in LIMES, a MeasureType class, a MeasureFactory class and a MeasureProcessor class:The IMeasure interface includes all the basic functions that any metric class must implement.\n\nThe AMeasure class implements the IMeasure interface.\n\nThe MeasureType class includes all the labels of the metrics implemented in LIMES. \n\nThe metrics are divided into type packages based on the type of property they are comparing (string, pointsets, space, topology and space). Each type package includes an interface and an abstract class, i.e. the string type package includes the IStringMeasure interface and the IStringMeasure abstract class. All metrics that belong to a particual type package must implement the corresponding interface and abstract class. Additionally, the type package abstract class must extend AMeasure and implement the corresponding type interface. The type interface must extend the IMeasure interface. \n\nThe MeasureFactory class returns an object of a measure given an input measure name. \n\nThe MeasureProcessor class is responsible for returning the similarity between two instances, given a simple or complex metric expression and a threshold.\n\n\nIf you want to create a new measure, you have to follow a set of steps:In case a suitable type package exists then:The new metric name must end with the word Measure.\n\nThe new metric must extend the type abstract class.\n\nThe new metric must implement all overriden methods of the type interface.

The Mapper packages includes the interface IMapper, the abstract class AMapper, a MapperFactory class and a MappingOperations class:The IMapper interface includes all the basic functions that any mapper class must implement.\n\nThe AMapper class implements the IMapper interface.\n\nThe mappers are divided into type packages based on the type of property their corresponding metrics are comparing (string, pointsets, space, topology and space).  All mappers must extend the AMapper abstrast class.\n\nThe MapperFactory class returns an object of a mapper given an input measure name. \n\nThe MappingOperations includes the basic functions between mappings.\n\n\nIf you want to create a new mapper, you have to follow a set of steps:\n1.

The new mapper must extend the `AMapper` abstrast class as a result, it must implement all overriden methods of the `IMapper` interface. No unsupported functions are allowed.\n3. Go to the `MapperFactory` class and add the choice of returning this mapper at the `createMapper` function following the pattern used for other mappers.\n"},"developer_manual/ls_pipeline.html":{"url":"developer_manual/ls_pipeline.html","title":"LSPipeline","keywords":"","body":"LSPipelineThe LSPipeline consists of three basic building blocks: Rewriter, Planner and ExecutionEngine.A Rewriter aims to simplify a given LS by removing potential redundancy, that eventually speeds up its execution.\n\nA Planner generates the plan of an input LS. For an atomic LS, it generates a simple Plan that consists of a RUN command. For a complex LS, it determines which atomic LS should be executed first, how to process intermediary results and identifies dependencies between atomic LSs. For example, a Planner can decide to first run some atomic LS and then filter the results using another atomic LS instead of running it independently and merging the results.\n\nAn ExecutionEngine is responsible for executing the Plan of an input LS. It takes as input a LS and a Planner, it executes  the Plan and returns the set of links as a AMapping.\n\nAll packages have the same hierarchy and they include the following set of classes:\nAn interface i.e. IExecutionEngine that includes all basic functions that an engine must implement.\n\nAn abstract class i.e. ExecutionEngine that implements the IExecutionEngine interface and must be extended by all engine classes.\n\nA factory class i.e. ExecutionEngineFactory that returns an object of an engine given an input engine name. \n\n\nThis code example, taken from the LSPipeline class, demonstrates the usage pattern:Rewriter rw = RewriterFactory.getRewriter(rewriterType);\nLinkSpecification rwLs = rw.rewrite(ls);\n// Planning execution of the LS\nPlanner planner = ExecutionPlannerFactory.getPlanner(executionPlannerType, sourceCache, targetCache);\n// Execute the ExecutionPlan obtained from the LS\nExecutionEngine engine = ExecutionEngineFactory.getEngine(executionEngineType, sourceCache, targetCache, sourceVar, targetVar);\nreturn engine.execute(rwLs, planner);\nIf you want to create a new engine or planner or rewriter class, you must follow a set of steps:The name of the new class must end with the word \"Engine\" or \"Planner\" or \"Rewriter\".\n\nThe new class must extend the ExecutionEngine or Planner or Rewriter abstract class and as a result implement all overriden methods from the corresponding interface. No unsupported functions are allowed.\n\nGo to the corresponding Factory class of the package and include a label for the new class at the enum class of allowed names. Then, create a public static final field of String type using the same name of engine/planner/rewriter as the one used in the enum class i.e. public static final String HELIOS = \"helios\"; and finally then add the choice of returing this engine/planner/rewriter at the i.e. getPlannerType and getPlanner functions following the pattern used for other engines/planners/rewriters.\n\n\n"},"developer_manual/ml_pipeline.html":{"url":"developer_manual/ml_pipeline.html","title":"MLPipeline","keywords":"","body":"MLPipelineThe MLPipeline acts as a simple facade for the three MLImplementationTypes of MLAlgorithms LIMES 1.0 offers: UNSUPERVISED, SUPERVISED_BATCH, SUPERVISED_ACTIVE.\nIn the following the patten for invoking a MLAlgorithm is presented.\nBecause many algorithms can support more than one MLImplementationType, to minimize redundant code, MLAlgorithm's should be implemented by extending the abstract class ACoreMLAlgorithm. ACoreMLAlgorithm's interface covers all three types, but not all three need to be implemented.\nFor each MLImplementationType there is a decorator class extending AMLAlgorithm. To use any MLAlgorithm in a safe way, pass its class type to the constructor of the decorator class corresponding to the MLImplementationType, e.g.:Class clazz = WombatComplete.class;\nUnsupervisedMLAlgorithm mlu = new UnsupervisedMLAlgorithm(clazz);\nThere also exists an MLAlgorithmFactory which offers a method getAlgorithmType(String name) to retrieve class types of algorithms from their names .\nThe usage patterns for the MLImplementationTypes are as follows:Unsupervised LearningIn unsupervised learning, predictions are made based on the structure of existing data. A helpful concept for unsupervised learning of links between knowledge bases is the so called Pseudo-F-measure (PFM). PFMs can be defined in various ways, but generally they are used to evaluate the intermediary results of the unsupervised learning algorithm, based only on its structure.\nInitialization works the same across all cases of ML. For unsupervised learning, we then pass a PFM to the learn() method, which returns an instance of class MLResults. We can use this result as a parameter to the predict function, which allows us to, for example, learn on smaller subsets of our data and then apply the learned classificators to the whole dataset.UnsupervisedMLAlgorithm mlu = new UnsupervisedMLAlgorithm(clazz);\nmlu.init(learningParameters, source, target);\nmlm = mlu.learn(pfm);\nmlu.predict(source, target, mlm);\nSupervised Batch LearningIn supervised batch learning, you learn to classify resp. evaluate future (a priori unknown) observations by looking at sufficiently many training examples, which are all known at the start of the algorithm.\nFor this to work really good, a lot of training data is needed.\nThe usage in limes is analogous to the unsupervised case, except this time, we do not pass a PFM to the learn() method. Instead, we pass it an instance of AMapping which stores our training data.SupervisedMLAlgorithm mls = new SupervisedMLAlgorithm(clazz);\nmls.init(learningParameters, source, target);\nmlm = mls.learn(trainingDataMap);\nmls.predict(source, target, mlm);\nSupervised Active LearningActive learning is like batch learning, except that the training examples are generated on the fly, by selecting example observations upon which different intermediary results of the algorithm disagree the most. An oracle (mostly a human expert) is then prompted to evaluate the selected examples, which are then fed back into the algorithm as training examples.\nThis is why in LIMES an active learning algorithm's activeLearn method can be called without parameters, e.g. for the first step of selecting appropriate examples for user evaluation (which is actually unsupervised), or it can be called with an instance of AMapping, storing the training examples.\nFor retrieving the examples for user evaluation, the getNextExamples method returns an instance of AMapping.ActiveMLAlgorithm mla = new ActiveMLAlgorithm(clazz);\nmla.init(learningParameters, source, target);\nmlm = mla.activeLearn(); \nAMapping nextExamples = mla.getNextExamples(maxIterations);\n// retrieve assessments from oracle and update scores in nextExamples accordingly\nmlm = mla.activeLearn(nextExamples);\nmla.predict(source, target, mlm);\n"}}}
